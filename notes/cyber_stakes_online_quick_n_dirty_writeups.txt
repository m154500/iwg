    0) convert hex string to actual hex
    1) git clone https://github.com/hellman/xortool.git
    2) install xortool
    3) use xortool to guess the key
        keep in mind that 20 == ord(' ') is the most frequent character in text
        // 00 is the most frequent in binary

filesurgery
    1) dl scalpel
    2) found that the filesys has a bmp with strings
    3) tried to scalpel bmp unsuccessfully
    4) found bmp in filesys with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format#Example_1
    5) noticed that scalpel has the wrong sig for bmp. It doesn't allow for certain sized bmp's.
    6) fixed bmp sig to: bmp     y       100000  BM???\x00\x00\x00
    7) ran scalpel and found the bmp
    8) the bmp was a bit corrupted, but I could still glean the key from it.
