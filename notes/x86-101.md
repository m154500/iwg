Intro
-----

x86 is RISC (aka it's complicated.)
We're going to be using the intel flavor.

Registers
---------

4 general purpose registers are:
- eax = ax + ah + al // 16 bits, 8 bits, 8 bits
- ebx
- ecx
- edx

Special registers:
- ebp = block ptr, top of stack frame (greatest value in frame)
- esp = stack ptr, bottom of stack (smallest value in frame)
- eip = inst ptr

Ops
---

add REG1 REG2 // adds the two registers together and puts into REG1
sub REG1 REG2 // subtraction is like addition, but it's subtraction
push REG // { put REG at the bottom of the stack; esp++; }

C to x86 Conversion Examples
----------------------------

Ex 1. Function definition:
    C:
        int f(int x){
            return x;
        }
    x86:
        global f
        f:
            ; BEGIN PROLOGUE
            push ebp            ; Save ebp for later.
            mov ebp, esp        ; aka ebp := esp (move the block ptr down)
            ; END PROLOGUE

            mov eax, [ebp+8]    ; ebp+8 is always the first argument*

            ; BEGIN EPILOGUE
            mov esp, ebp        ; reload esp (unnecessary here)
            pop ebp             ; reload ebp from its original value
            ret                 ; moves the instruction pointer (eip)
            ; END EPILOGUE

    *assuming first argument is an int. It'll really be [ebp+TYPESIZE]

Ex 2. Function call:
    C:
        f(y);
    x86:
        mov eax, [ebp-0x22] ; assume eax contains y
        push eax            ; put y 
        call f
        ; DO FUNCTION
        ; I missed everything after this

Ex 3. Get a string:
    x86:
        global g
        g:
            push ebp
            mov ebp, esp

            sub esp, 256    ; allocs 256 bytes AKA 64 DWORDS
            push esp
            call gets       ; gets a string

            mov esp, ebp
            pop ebp
            ret
    C:
        void g(){
            char buf[256];
            gets(buf);
        }

    NOTE:   This is your classic buffer overflow opportunity.
            Overwrite past ebp and into the return address,
            and you can tell it to execute your shell code.
