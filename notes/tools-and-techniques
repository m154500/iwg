Index of CTF Tools and Techniques
=================================

Purpose
-------

I often learn about useful tools and techniques to use in CTFs, only to forget about them during competition. This file will help us remember them.



Tools
-----

dd - linux CLI - powerful version of cp that allows one to scrape hidden files. Example: dd if=secret.jpg bs=1 skip=1337 of=hidden.zip 

ltrace - linux CLI - returns calls to libraries invoked in execution of an executable. Example: ltrace ./crackme ARG1 ARG2

printf - linux CLI - handy for converting hex to decimal for the skip argument of dd. Example: printf "%d\n" 0x00deadbeef

tr - linux CLI - translates characters from STDIN according to two sets of characters. Example: cat foo.txt | tr 'ABCD' '1234'

xxd - linux CLI - get a hexdump of a binary. Can also reverse a hexdump back into a binary. Example: xxd foo.gif



Tips
----

Frequency analysis: 
- The most frequent letters in English are "ETAOIN SHRDLU" from most to less frequent.
- The most frequent two-letter combinations in English are "th", "er", "on", "an", "re", and "he".
- The most frequent three-letter combinations in English are "the", "and", "tha", and "ent".

/usr/share/dict/words - linux - Contains a dictionary of English words. Useful with grep to manually solve substitution ciphers.
