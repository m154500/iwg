Becoming a Cyber Laywer
=======================

Intro
-----
</p>
Every proper CDX team needs a cyber lawyer team. For years, the IWG did not believe it was needed, but,
each of those years, we lost lots of points due to not understanding the rules well enough to properly 
follow them or argue our case. Most people are too busy specializing on technical aspects of CDX to have
time to become masters of the rules. This is where the cyber lawyers come in.

The path to becoming a cyber lawyer before STARTEX is pretty straightforward. The team lead, who should be
someone who has participated in CDX before, should coordinate the following tasks among the team:
1. Read all the rules once for overall understanding.
2. Read all the rules again, very carefully. 
3. Work with the team to make a cheat sheet that contains several lists:
  - Important rules to keep in mind (especially changes from previous years)
  - Emergent points derived from combinations of rules (especially loopholes)
  - Points of ambiguity that need White Cell clarification
  Be sure to cite all the rules contained within these lists!
4. As everyone prepares their services, make sure they are fully compliant and that no tasks are being missed.
5. Profit!

Cyber lawyers need to be aware of everything that is happening during CDX in order to ensure that the team is
not at risk of losing points.
