Becoming a Cyber Laywer
=======================

Intro
-----
Every proper CDX team needs a cyber lawyer team. For years, the IWG did not believe it was needed, but,
each of those years, we lost lots of points due to not understanding the rules well enough to properly 
follow them or argue our case. Most people are too busy specializing on technical aspects of CDX to have
time to become masters of the rules. This is where the cyber lawyers come in.

Ad bellum
-----------
The path to becoming a cyber lawyer before STARTEX is pretty straightforward. The team lead, who should be
someone who has participated in CDX before, should coordinate the following tasks among the team:

1. Read all the rules once for overall understanding.
2. Read all the rules again, very carefully. 
3. Work with the team to make a cheat sheet that contains several lists (cite all rules in the lists!):
  * Important rules to keep in mind (especially changes from previous years)
  * Emergent points derived from combinations of rules (especially loopholes)
  * Points of ambiguity that need White Cell clarification
4. As everyone prepares their services, make sure they are fully compliant and that no tasks are being missed.
5. Profit!

In bello
--------
Cyber lawyers need to be aware of everything that is happening during CDX in order to ensure that the team is
not at risk of losing points. Thus, cyber lawyering has some inherent leadership responsibilities. However, there
is no reason that the cyber lawyers must have formal leadership positions within CDX.
NOT DONE! More joyous wonder is yet to come!
